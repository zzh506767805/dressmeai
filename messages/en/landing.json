    "items": [
      {
        "question": "What is AI virtual try-on technology?",
        "answer": "AI virtual try-on uses artificial intelligence and computer vision to create realistic simulations of how clothes would look on your body. Simply upload a photo of yourself and a clothing image, and our AI generates a visualization of you wearing that outfit."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is the virtual try-on?",
        "answer": "Our AI technology provides highly realistic results that accurately represent how clothes will look on you. While virtual try-ons are approximations and actual fit may vary slightly, our technology helps you make more informed purchase decisions and significantly reduces the likelihood of returns."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is DressMeAI free to use?",
        "answer": "DressMeAI offers both free and premium options. You can try our basic virtual try-on features for free, with premium features available for advanced users and businesses."
      },
      {
        "question": "What types of photos work best?",
        "answer": "For best results, use clear, well-lit photos where the person is standing straight and facing the camera. The clothing in the photo should be relatively form-fitting to help the AI understand your body shape."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my data and photos secure?",
        "answer": "Yes, we take data security very seriously. Your photos are processed securely by our AI system and are not permanently stored unless you explicitly save them to your history. Our system is designed with privacy at its core."
